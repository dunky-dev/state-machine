 * so typos are compile errors). The bridge runs each effect inside its own
 * `createEffect` and READS those named props there, so Solid's auto-tracking
 * re-runs the effect (cleanup → setup) only when one of those props actually
 * changes — not on unrelated changes, never stale. `machine` is a constant, so
 * it's not a dependency.
 *
 * The tuple shape is identical across every target (React, Solid, …) so a
 * component's effects are authored ONCE and run unchanged everywhere; only how
 * the bridge consumes the deps differs (a manual dep array on React, reactive
 * reads here).
